## 💻 Ongoing Projects:
At the moment I'm developing an informative web app with friends about nature and sustainability.

## 💻 Projects:

🎸 [OffBeat](https://luminous-monstera-7fc751.netlify.app/login) - A full stack web app that is a social network for amateur musicians to showcase their work, form bands and meet other artists. Here, the user is able to make posts in a timeline, send/accept/decline friend requests, send messages and leave reviews on bands and artists.

👘 [EcoLux Couture](https://ecolux-couture.onrender.com/) - A full stack web app where the visitor can create a profile and search for clothing luxury brands that have implemented good sustainability practices and add them to favourites as well as look for organizations in the sustainable fashion field.

⌨️ [Desert Runner](https://pinto-andre.github.io/desert-reptiles-game/) - A desert themed game where the player's objective is to get the highest score.
